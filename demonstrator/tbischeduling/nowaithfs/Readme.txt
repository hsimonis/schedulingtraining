For all three benchmarks, we followed the same data structure:

The number of jobs is specified in the first line.
The number of stages is in the second line.
The number of machines per stage is in the third line.
Next, we define the categories of each machine (Machine_Speeds), where an old machine is represented by 1.0 and a new machine by 1.1. Each line represents the available machines in a stage.

Finally, the processing time is structured by job, stage, and machine, and is calculated based on machine speed.
