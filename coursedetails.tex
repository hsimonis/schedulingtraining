\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This document describes the detailed structure of a training course on AI based scheduling for the ENTIRE EDIH project. The training course provides an overview of current Constraint-based techniques to model and solve scheduling problems arising in project scheduling and manufacturing industries. It provides some hands-on experience with available open-source tools, and also describes key features of commercial solutions.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This document provides an outline of a two-day training program on AI based scheduling using constraint programming techniques. The document details the topics covered from the viewpoint of the course developer, it is not intended to be read by the potential audience. A separate description of the course focussing on business needs and benefits will be developed in parallel. 

\section{Intended Audience}
\label{sec:audience}

The course is intended for decision makers and persons facing scheduling problems in their professional work. IT personnel or consultants charged with choice of tools, development of models, or integration into the existing infrastructure will also be interested.

\section{Learning Outcomes}
\label{sec:outcomes}

After attending the course, the students should be able to

\begin{itemize}
\item Position Constraint Based Scheduling in the general AI field
\item Understand the need and potential for automated scheduling
\item Understand the basic ideas behind Constraint-Based Scheduling
\begin{itemize}
\item Declarative modeling
\item Abstraction of complex solving methods
\item Explainable reasoning
\end{itemize}
\item Identify and apply the basic constraint types occurring in scheduling
\item Understand the strength and weaknesses of available tools
\item Be aware of basic visualization methods for scheduling
\end{itemize}


\section{Timetable}
\label{sec:timetable}

Table~\ref{tab:timetable} shows the format of the course delivered in a two-day event, with ten hours total teaching time. The course consists of seven modules, which will be described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:modules}. Alternatively, the course could be presented as ten one hour sessions (plus exercises) for self-study.

\section{Modules}
\label{sec:modules}

This section gives a brief bullet-point list of the key elements of each of the modules of the course. The course will be delivered as a mix of overview slides, some example problems and solutions using different solvers, and a hands-on session to explore programs and demonstrators. 

The overall approach is morphology based, i.e. based on the structure of problems found in industry. This differs from a complexity/structural analysis often used in OR, or a technology based presentation used in Computer Science.
