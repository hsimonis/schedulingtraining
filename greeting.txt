You do not need to bring your own laptop, our hands-on lab will use one of the Computer Science labs in our building. 

If you have any specific scheduling related questions, or interest in a particular type of problem, please let me know by email, so that I can prepare some materials in advance.

I'm looking forward to seeing you on Thursday!

Best regards

Helmut
