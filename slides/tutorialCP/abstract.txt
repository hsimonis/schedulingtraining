Modelling for Scheduling and Rostering Problems with Constraint Programming
Helmut Simonis, Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Cork

Scheduling and Personnel Rostering are two of the most successful application domains for Constraint Programming (CP). For many problems in these areas, CP provides the best compromise between a rapid development process, performance of the resulting tool, and the ability to keep the solution up-to-date with changing requirements. In this tutorial we focus on the modeling of such problems with different CP tools, how to identify and describe the constraints of a problem, and how to test and tune models for practical problem instances. We describe the main alternatives of describing such constraint models, either using high-level modeling languages, programming language APIs, or domain specific data models, and discuss the main advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches. To illustrate these concepts, we present examples of a number of large scale, industrial applications in these domains, and give an overview of the existing literature in the field.
